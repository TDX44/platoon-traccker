## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Treat this as a brownfield stabilization project.
- Initialization: Keep Clerk, SQLite, Docker Compose, and the vanilla JS frontend for the first milestone.
- Initialization: Use coarse phases and track planning docs in git.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Production Gunicorn path may not run the midnight reset worker started only under `python server.py`.
- No automated tests exist yet for authentication, authorization, roster updates, scheduled statuses, backup, or restore.
- Production-critical configuration currently has unsafe or ambiguous defaults.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Frontend | Split large inline frontend script into modules | v2 | Initialization |
| Operations | Add CI and structured logging | v2 | Initialization |
